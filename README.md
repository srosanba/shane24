Guidance per JW:

Consider this as X Rho24 days and do the following: 

1. Write X short (1-2 paragraph) proposals to think things through a bit before jumping in [I am happy to review these if you like].
1. Spend about a day on each project. Work the problem. Do a little pilot. See if there is a there there.
1. Write a short (1-2 paragraph) summary of each day. Link to relevant materials created [I definitely want to see these].

List of candidate topics, in order of perceived viability *prior to having written the proposal paragraphs*.

1. Revisit hybrid approach for stacked bar charts  
  a. Offset bar charts, line charts, etc.
1. SAS implementation of "Safety Explorer - Snapshots"  
  a. This is primarily a tool to help validate the output from CF. 
  b. This is NOT a quick-start for CSR displays.
1. Examination/Visualization of Data Domains used at Rho  
  a. If this is what I think it is, we want to generate sets of plots for various data domains: AE plots, Lab plots, PK plots, etc.
  b. Exactly what form this takes is unclear: a concepts paper with pretty picture, sets of code for each data domain, other?
1. SAS version of network diagrams  
  a. Investigate SAS VA implementation.
1. Evaluation of our graphics accessibility per NIH guidelines  
  a. Colorblind, visually impaired, etc.
1. Machine learning  
  a. Very fuzzy, but mandatory per Jeremy.
1. Restart our "Commonly used Charts" survey  
  a. If this is what I think it is, my view is that the SGPLOT wiki finished this off.
1. SAS version of steam graph (assuming you mean “stream” graph)  
  a. Looks kind of busy.
1. SAS version of something else from http://www.datavizcatalogue.com/  
  a. I managed to talk myself out of most of what I saw as  
    1. easily doable in SGPLOT, or  
    1. already done by someone else, or  
    1. not applicable to clinical trials, or  
    1. not a good graphic
1. SAS version of Volcano plots  
  a. Just a scatter plot. What’s the big deal?
1. SAS version of chord diagram  
  a. Cool idea, but Sanjay Matange recently published on this.

1. SAS version of heat maps  
  a. SAS has a HEATMAP statement in SGPLOT
